WIRESHARK NETWORK TRAFFIC ANALYSIS REPORT

Objective:
To capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark and identify different network protocols.

Tool Used:
Wireshark (Ubuntu Linux)

Network Interface Used:
wlp4s0 (WiFi Interface)

Procedure:

1. Installed Wireshark on Ubuntu system.
2. Selected active network interface (wlp4s0).
3. Started packet capture.
4. Generated traffic by browsing websites and using ping command.
5. Captured packets for approximately one minute.
6. Stopped capture and applied protocol filters.

Protocols Identified:

1. DNS (Domain Name System)
Purpose: Resolves domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.
Observation: DNS query and response packets were observed.

2. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Purpose: Provides reliable communication between devices.
Observation: TCP 3-way handshake packets (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) were observed.

3. TLS (Transport Layer Security)
Purpose: Provides encrypted communication for HTTPS websites.
Observation: Encrypted TLS handshake packets were identified when accessing secure websites.

4. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
Purpose: Used for network diagnostics (ping).
Observation: ICMP echo request and echo reply packets were captured.

Findings:
The packet capture contained multiple protocol types including DNS queries, TCP connections, encrypted TLS sessions, and ICMP traffic.

Conclusion:
Wireshark successfully captured live network traffic and allowed identification of multiple protocols. This exercise improved understanding of packet structures and network communication processes.

Learning Outcome:
- Learned how to capture network traffic
- Identified common network protocols
- Applied display filters for analysis
- Gained hands-on packet inspection experience

Ethical Note:
The packet capture was performed on my own system for educational purposes only.
